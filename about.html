            <p>For many LGBTQ+ individuals who grew up in the American South, contemporary Christian teachings often estrange members of the queer community who turn towards the church doctrine for support. 
                <br><br>I, as the mapmaker have long assumed that Christian Churches would not be an accepting place within the South for those of us who would like to mend our relationships between Church and self. 
                This map charts a five-mile radius around the <i>Univesity of Tennesee at Chattanooga</i> as a guide for accepting Churches within the area. This map is ever-evolving, as more experiences are gathered 
                to create a more complete picture of the Churches within Chattanooga.<br><br>This data is current as of February 4, 2024. To update the map with your experience please consider clicking
